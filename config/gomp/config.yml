# Mappings
#
# Mapping works in the following way:
# Function: [ firstMapping, secondMapping, thirdMapping, ...... ]
# for e.g
togglePlayBack : [ "p", "SPACE", "]" ] # using the quotes is neccessary.
  # all the three keys now have the same function.

# Caching
#
# The Covert arts that are extracted from the file or downloaded from lastfm
# are cached. It Is neccessary to define a cache directory to store all
# the cover arts. The Caching works as follows
# 1. Check if there is an embedded cover art if not then 2
# 2. Check if lastfm has album art if not then 3
# 3. Fallback to the default image.
#
#
CACHE_DIR : "~/.config/gomp/cache/"
  # for e.g "~/.config/gomp/cache/"
  # You will have to manually create this directory.
